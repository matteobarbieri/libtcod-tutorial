### Next

* A junction should have a minimun size of 2+ the width of the corridor it
  originates from.

### Backlog

* Corridors widths should be weighted, that is the average width should be more
  likely than extreme values.
* Also directions taken should be weighted, in order to sort of control the
 general geometry of the level.

### Done
